In this problem session, I will introduce ongoing work on precisely-typed open recursion by Andong Fan and Lionel Parreaux and draw a brief comparison with our approach.

Since 16 March is HKU Foundation Day, you can decide whether to attend this problem session at will. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to your attendance as we invited Andong as a special guest.
