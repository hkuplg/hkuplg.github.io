CodeWave is an intelligent low-code platform developed by NetEase for accelerating application development. The core of CodeWave is the statically-typed, visual programming language NASL and the programming system built upon it. 

In this talk, I will introduce several key challenges in designing and implementing NASL and its associated programming system, including how to simplify application development using LLM, how to add expressiveness while not making the learning curve steep, how to make the generated code configurable. I will share the principles and experiences we applied in addressing these challenges, such as cognitive dimensions of notations and Jakubovic et alâ€™s technical dimensions of programming systems.
