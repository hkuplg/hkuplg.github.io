## Abstract

The topic of this seminar is related to the inference of applications involved with intersection types and their semantics design.

I will summarise previously proposed ideas and present the applicative subtyping, a specialized subtyping algorithm to help the inference. This algorithm can be adopted in a type sound calculus, which is able to encode features like overloaded functions, extensible records, return type overloading and nested composition.

p.s. Zoom link will be posted in the slack channel before the seminar starts.
