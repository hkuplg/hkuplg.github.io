## Abstract

Modern LLMs excel at various reasoning tasks, including solving math and programming problems, yet they struggle to advance in complex, frontier domains. A key contributing factor is the scarcity of high-quality problemâ€“answer pairs. Natural language reasoning inherently leads to ambiguity and complexity, making it hard to verify the model's outputs. Proof assistants such as Lean4 provide a principled framework for verifying the logical validity of proofs, thereby improving both efficiency and rigor. This formalization-based approach can also be extended to broader scientific domains. For instance, computational tools can be employed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of experimental designs generated by LLMs. This talk will explore the role of formalization in LLM reasoning and its potential impact on future research.
