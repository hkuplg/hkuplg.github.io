This is a guest talk by Jason Hu from McGill University (website: https://hustmphrrr.github.io)

### Abstract

In this talk, we describe a type theory based on modal logic which supports meta-programming and intensional analysis. What sits at the core is the idea of layering. In a layered modal type theory, a language at a higher layer extends one at a lower layer with the extra power of meta-programming through the box modality. This architecture not only ensures a universal run primitive which executes code as programs, but also enables pattern matching on code while still retaining normalization. Our type theory is proven normalization by evaluation using an extended presheaf model. We see this development as a significant first step to support meta-programming in proof assistants' core languages.
