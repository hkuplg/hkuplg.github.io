## Abstract

As AI moves from assisting developers to generating code at scale, programming
languages face a new design frontier. Instead of retrofitting existing languages
for automation, what if we design languages that are AI-native from the start?

This talk uses MoonBit as a case study to explore that question. MoonBit is a
new language and toolchain built with vertical AI integration in mind—its
compiler, build system, IDE and APIs are designed to be both human-friendly and
machine-friendly. I will discuss how MoonBit’s design choices open opportunities
for scalable software synthesis, and what challenges remain in bridging human-AI
collaboration.

## Bio of the Speaker

Hongbo Zhang currently serves as the Chair Scientist and Department Head of
Digital Infrastructure Innovation at IDEA(www.idea.edu.cn/research/dii.html). In
this role, he is leading the development of the MoonBit
Platform(www.moonbitlang.com).

He is most known as the author of the ReScript programming language, formerly
known as ReasonML and BuckleScript. Zhang received his Bachelor of Science in
Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University. He holds a Master's degree from
the University of Pennsylvania, where he also undertook doctoral studies as an
active member of the esteemed Programming Language Club (PLClub). His transition
from academia to the corporate world was marked by a special invitation from
Bloomberg LP(2014-2017). There, he played the chief role in the development of
BuckleScript. In 2017, he accepted an invitation from Facebook to continue his
work on BuckleScript, which subsequently evolved into the ReScript programming
language.He also contributed to the development of another programming language
at Facebook (Meta), Flow.
