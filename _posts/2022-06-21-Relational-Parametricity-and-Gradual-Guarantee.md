## Abstract
While relational parametricity is an important property for a parametric polymorphism calculus, gradual guarantee is an important criteria for gradual typing. A long-standing challenge has been to prove both properties for a polymorphic gradually typed system. There is a paper pointed out that these two properties are incompatible. In this talk, I will discuss about them.
