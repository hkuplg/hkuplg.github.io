In my last seminar, I presented my current research about contextual type inference, which generlised bidirectional typing. Several months later, we got a clearer understanding of it and make it scalable so that those ideas are not restricted to simple types.

In this seminar, I still overview my research first, disccussing the theory on STLC. We then expand our topic to intersection types and polymophic types and see what'll happen.
