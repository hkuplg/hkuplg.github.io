title:   "Typing as Reduction: Yet Another Perspective on Type Inference"
authors: Chen
date:    2025-08-20 10:10:00 GMT+8
venue:   Zoom
---

In this seminar, I will present our ongoing work on a type-inference approach that views typing as a reduction process, drawing inspiration from operational semantics.
I will illustrate this approach using the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC) and then discuss both the benefits and the challenges of extending it to richer type systems such as System F.

As the seminar rooms are still under maintenance, the session will be held **online** via Zoom:
