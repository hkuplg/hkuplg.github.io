In this seminar, I will discuss how to formalize normalization-by-evaluation of 
dependently typed theories in Agda. We will mainly focus on two systems: MLTT (we will discuss what we mean by MLTT in the talk) 
with  a cumulative and non-cumulative universe and show the soundness of completeness of NbE using 
logical relations (closely related to Chapter 6 of ATTAPL). 
This is a joint work with Jason Hu from McGill.

We will turn our focus to the non-cunmulative system this time, but now we have some 
more results (and better notations!). 
I will also share some lessons and tricks learned in mechanization. As this 
talks is supposed to be a problem session, I will try to provide some contents about future work.
