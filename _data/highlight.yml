- work: Disjoint Intersection Types
  description: These are a series of works about disjoint intersection types. By supporting a merge operator, the calculi with disjoint intersection types provide general mechanisms that can subsume various other features. Such calculi can also encode highly dynamic forms of object composition, which capture common programming patterns in dynamically typed languages (such as JavaScript) in a fully statically typed manner.
