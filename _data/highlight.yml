- description: This line of work explores the theoretical aspects of the <i>merge operator</i> and develops novel notions such as <i>disjoint intersection types</i>, <i>disjoint polymorphism</i>, <i>nested composition</i>, <i>disjoint switches</i>, <i>type difference</i>, <i>dependent merges</i>, and <i>type-directed operational semantics</i>.
